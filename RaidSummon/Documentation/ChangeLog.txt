RaidSummon 2.2.2 (bugfix release 2)

Core:
- Fixed an error popup when player cannot summon and no alternative summoners were found.


RaidSummon 2.2.1 (bugfix release)
================

Core:
- RaidSummon will no longer get stuck when trying to summon while sitting.
- The addon should now override Titan Panel's Dropdown Menu "bugfix" bug.
- Removed some left over debug code.


RaidSummon 2.2
==============

Highlights of this version are the significantly improved auto-summoning mode and action-button flashing support.
Autosummoning now selectes players by distance and no longer requires localized zone-tables. As a sideeffect of this improvement, RaidSummon can now redirect requesters to other warlock if you are already in an instance an the requester is not, if you are afk, out of shards or have a full queue. The code will select the warlock closest to your position or the instance gate and even prefer warlocks with at least 2 assistants in their proximity. Currently RaidSummon simply tells the requester which warlock can summon him best, the next version will automatically enqueue the requester with that warlock's RaidSummon.
Also, action-button flashing has been added, so even if you miss the on-screen message, the flashing Ritual of Summoning button will remind you that there are still players in the queue waiting to be summoned.

UI:
- The "Ritual of Summoning" action will now flash while players are queued and this feature is enabled.
- Extended action-menu (right click the "Ritual of Summoning"-action with an option to toggle action button flashing on/off.
- Added "Summon" option to the context menu of your current target (if it is in your group/raid).
- Reduced size/text of RaidSummons announcement; the announcement will now list the first defined keyword.
- Entries of the summoning menus will now also be updated while the menu is open.

Core:
- While in an instance, requests from outside will be redirected to a warlock who is not in the instance, if possible.
- Players requesting to be summoned while you are AFK, out of shards or have a full queue will be redirected to another warlock in your character's proximity.
- You can no longer summon offline players. If a player is offline and more players are in queued, those will be summoned first.
- You can now properly summon yourself in groups.
- Keywords are now spefic to the language chosen for interaction with other players.
- Automatic summoning now also works in normal groups.
- Automatic summoning of distant members now distance instead of zone based. Default distance 1500 yrds.
- French translation updated by cthol. Thank you! :)
- Minimal distance for automatic summoning can be changed with /rsm distance x.
- Added /rsm tf to toggle "Ritual of Summoning" action button flashing on/off.

Script:
- Ritual of Summoning detection now independet of localization.
- Complete code restructurization.
- Rewrote summon & retargetting system. This should now always work properly.
- Initial code to handle the new addon channels (will later be used to distribute summons evenly among all warlocks in the raid).
